# Printing phase

Inside the selected slicer (in this case, the proprietary MarkForged slicer has been adopted), the gripper must be positioned as shown in the figure below.

Once printed, necessary supports need to be removed. In the following figure, supports are coloured violet.

Next, a pin must be inserted in the hole of the flexible hinge to make the cam path work (picture below). For the current design, a pin of 2 mm in diameter fits the hole (with 0.2 mm of interference). The minimum height of the pin to make contact with the cam path is 6 mm.
